3. Classes in Java contain member variables and methods. Give a brief explanation for each:
   1. Member Variables:
   2. Methods:

4. In groups: The following are lines of code that could belong to a Shopping Cart class, but are out of order. Copy this code into a java file, then arrange the code to make a functional class. (In your groups, once you re-order the code, use your annotate tools to put a * next to any attributes, and a box around any methods. Then someone take a screen shot.)

```java
this.items.add(item)

public void add_item(String item, double price){

public ArrayList<String> items = new ArrayList<String>();

public String store;

public double total;

public class ShoppingCart {

this.total += price;

}

}
```
